            <h3>Phase 1</h3>
            <p>
                When selecting an API, I really wanted to do one on something
                I was interested in, something that I am currently playing/have played,
                something that I would genuinely find useful to use if I stumbled upon it randomly.
                As I searched through the list of APIs given to us, Genshin was one of the ones
                that stood out to me. At first, I wanted to make it possible for users to search up
                just about anything from the game, whether it be a character, an artifact, a boss, etc.
                This was my thinking as I created mockups and set everything up.

            <h3>Phase 2</h3>
            <p>
                As I began to start coding the site, I realized just how many different kind of filters
                I could do, how many assets the API actually had access to. It overwhelmed me, and I was already
                struggling with coding basic JavaScript. I reduced the scope to just filtering through the
                characters, which made it a lot easier as I only had one thing to think about. In terms of meeting
                the requirements, I have several ways to filter out the results, as well as a sorting function.

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of grading, I would give myself maybe an A or B as I believe I have met all
            the basic requirements for the assignment.
